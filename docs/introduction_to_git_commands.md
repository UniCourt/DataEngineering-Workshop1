```
Basic commands of git:

git init
the command git init is used to create an empty Git repository.

git add
 Add command is used after checking the status of the files, to add t	hose files to the staging area.
 Before running the commit command, "git add" is used to add any new or modified files.

git commit
 The commit command makes sure that the changes are saved to the local repository.
 The command "git commit –m <message>" allows you to describe everyone and help them understand what has happened.

git status
 The git status command tells the current state of the repository.
 The command provides the current working branch. If the files are in the staging area, but not committed, it will be shown by the git status. 
 Also, if there are no changes, it will show the message no changes to commit, working directory clean.
 
git config
The git config command is used initially to configure the user.name and user.email. This specifies what email id and username will be used from a local repository.
```

### Creating a pull request
A pull request – also referred to as a merge request – is an event that takes place in software development when a contributor/developer is ready to begin the process of merging new code changes with the main project repository.
